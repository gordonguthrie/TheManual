## How built-in synthdefs are loaded

Let's go hunting for the code that loads synth definitions and see what it does.

This is the boot sequence:

![boot sequence](../images/uml/boot_sequence.png)

Using a combination of the logging techniques in the previous section we can soon find out roughly how it works.

The very earliest message we see in the GUI is:

```
=> Welcome to Sonic Pi v5.0.0-Tech Preview 2
```

This message is sent from the [runtime module](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/dev/app/server/ruby/lib/sonicpi/runtime.rb#L558):

```ruby
  def __load_buffer(id)
      id = id.to_s
      raise "Aborting load: file name is blank" if  id.empty?
      path = File.expand_path("#{Paths.project_path}/#{id}.spi")
      s = "# Welcome to Sonic Pi\n\n"
      if File.exist? path
        s = IO.read(path)
      end
      __replace_buffer(id, s)
    end
```

That function `__load_buffer` is called in one place and one place only, by the [spider server](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/dev/app/server/ruby/bin/spider-server.rb).

We know that the `spider-server` is special because it sits in `app/bin` and not `app/server/ruby/lib/sonicpi` like the rest of the ruby code.

Spider has its own log in `~/.sonic-pi/logs` and if we look at them we can figure out what's going on:

```

Spider - ------------------------------------------
```

It co-ordinates the dance with the Tau server that handles timing and events and the SuperCollider server which actually makes the sounds.

Somewhere in here it starts up the [sound module](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/dev/app/server/ruby/lib/sonicpi/lang/sound.rb#L68) that actually starts the `studio`.

If we examine the `initialize` method of the class [Studio](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/dev/app/server/ruby/lib/sonicpi/studio.rb#L25) and match what happens we can see how the synth definitions are loaded:

```ruby
    def initialize(ports, msg_queue, state, register_cue_event_lambda, current_spider_time_lambda)

      STDOUT.puts "studio - init"
      STDOUT.flush

      @state = state
      @scsynth_port = ports[:scsynth_port]
      @scsynth_send_port = ports[:scsynth_send_port]
      @msg_queue = msg_queue
      @error_occured_mutex = Mutex.new
      @error_occurred_since_last_check = false
      @sample_sem = Mutex.new
      @reboot_mutex = Mutex.new
      @rebooting = false
      @cent_tuning = 0
      @sample_format = "int16"
      @paused = false
      @register_cue_event_lambda = register_cue_event_lambda
      @current_spider_time_lambda = current_spider_time_lambda
      @global_timewarp = 0
      init_scsynth
      reset_server
      init_studio
    end
```

If we trace down the last three function invocations and match their log messages to those in the `spider.log` we can see this function setting everything up for the user - after the SuperCollider and Tau engines have both started.

The last function to run on creating a new Studio is [init_studio](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/dev/app/server/ruby/lib/sonicpi/studio.rb#L72) and it loads the synthdefs:

```ruby
    def init_studio
      @server.load_synthdefs(Paths.synthdef_path)
      @amp = [0.0, 1.0]
      @server.add_event_handler("/sonic-pi/amp", "/sonic-pi/amp") do |payload|
        @amp = [payload[2], payload[3]]
      end
```

Actually it tells the [server](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/dev/app/server/ruby/lib/sonicpi/server.rb#L155) to load them: which it does by sending an OSC message to SuperCollider:

```ruby
    def load_synthdefs(path)
      info "Loading synthdefs from path: #{path}" if @debug_mode
      with_done_sync [@osc_path_d_loaddir] do
        osc @osc_path_d_loaddir, path.to_s
      end
    end
```

The format of the message is an instruction to load code and a filepath - so at this stage Sonic Pi doesn't know anything more about the built in synthesisers other than their location `etc/synthdefs/compiled`.

If we pop a new compiled synthdef in here it will load on boot automatically.
