## Chapter 5 - Recreating the beep Synth

A simple beep synthesiser - 2nd version in SuperCollider

This synth accepts the following parameters:

* `note` a midi note
* `amp` a volume
* `pan` a location to pan to
* `sustain` the time the sound lasts: WATCH OUT! - this is not called `duration`


```supercollider
(SynthDef('sonic-pi-mysecondsynth', {| out = 0, note = 52.0, amp = 1, pan = 0, sustain = 1 |
```

define the variables that we will use later

```supercollider
     var snd, env, freq;
```

convert the midi note to frequency

```supercollider
     freq = midicps(note);
```

set up an envelope that lasts as long as the sustain value

```supercollider
     env = Line.kr(0.1, 0.0, sustain, doneAction: 2);
```

get a beep from the Sin Oscillator and then place it in the Pan
and set the volume

```supercollider
     snd = Pan2.ar(SinOsc.ar(freq, 0, env), pos: pan, level: amp);
```

play

```supercollider
     Out.ar(out, snd)
}).writeDefFile("/home/gordon/.synthdefs"))

```
