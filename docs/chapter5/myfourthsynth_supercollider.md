## Chapter 5 - Recreating the beep Synth

A simple beep synthesiser - fourth and final version in SuperCollider

This synth accepts the following parameters:

* `note` a midi note
* `note_slide` the time in beats it takes for a note to change when controlling a synth (0 means a step change)
* `note_slide_shape` the shape of the transition of the note
* `note_slide_curve` for custom shapes whether the transition curves up or down
* `pan` a location to pan to (between -1.0 and 1.0)
* `pan_slide` - like `note_slide` but for `pan`
* `pan_slide_shape` - like `note_slide_shape` but for `pan`
* `pan_slide_curve` - like `note_slide_curve` but for `pan`
* `amp` a volume (0.0 to 1.0)
* `amp_slide` - like `note_slide` but for `amp`
* `amp_slide_shape` - like `note_slide_shape` but for `amp`
* `amp_slide_curve` - like `note_slide_curve` but for `amp`
* `attack` amount of time for sound to build up to full amplitude
* `decay` amount of time for sound to move from the attack to the sustain level
* `sustain` amount of time the sound is sustained
* `release` amount of time for sound to go from the sustained level to 0
* `attack_level` sound level at attack phase
* `decay_level` sound level in decay phase
* `sustain_level` sound level in sustain phase
* `env_curve` shape of the curve of volume transition
*
* the default value of `decay_level` is -1 even tho the only valid values of `decay_level`
* that Sonic Pi will ever accept are a greater than zero - this is used to test if a `decay_level` has been set


```supercollider
(SynthDef("sonic-pi-myfourthsynth", {| out_bus = 0,
	                        note = 52.0, note_slide = 0, note_slide_shape = 1, note_slide_curve = 0,
	                        amp = 1, amp_slide = 0, amp_slide_shape = 1, amp_slide_curve = 0,
	                        pan = 0, pan_slide = 0, pan_slide_shape = 1, pan_slide_curve = 0,
	                        attack = 0, decay = 0, sustain = 0, release = 1,
	                        attack_level = 1, decay_level = -1, sustain_level = 1,
	                        env_curve = 1 |
```

define the variables that we will use later

```supercollider
    var snd, env, freq, slid_note, slid_amp, slid_pan;
```

use the Select uGen and the invalid default value to make the `decay_level` be the
same as the `sustain_level` if no `decay_level` is set
if the `decay_level` is less than zero (i.e., the default -1) - use the zeroth member of the index, itself
otherwise use the first member - the `sustain_level`

```supercollider
	decay_level = Select.kr(decay_level < 0, [decay_level, sustain_level]);
```

Create an envelope with the full attack, decay, sustain, release shape
NOTE: there are 5 levels, but only 4 times and curves - the levels are the start and end of each section
      the times and curves are the section itself - in this synth the curve is the same for all elements

```supercollider
	env = EnvGen.kr(Env.new(levels: [0, attack_level, decay_level, sustain_level, 0],
		                    times:  [attack, decay, sustain, release], 
		                    curve:  Array.fill(4, env_curve)), doneAction: 2);
```

slide the note

```supercollider
	slid_note = VarLag.kr(note, note_slide, note_slide_curve, note_slide_shape);
	slid_amp = VarLag.kr(amp, amp_slide, amp_slide_curve, amp_slide_shape);
	slid_pan = VarLag.kr(pan, pan_slide, pan_slide_curve, pan_slide_shape);
```

convert the midi note to frequency

```supercollider
	freq = midicps(slid_note);
```

get a beep from the Sin Oscillator and then place it in the Pan
and set the volume

```supercollider
	snd = Pan2.ar(SinOsc.ar(freq, 0, env), pos: slid_pan, level: slid_amp);
```

play

```supercollider
	Out.ar(out_bus, snd)
}).writeDefFile("/home/gordon/.synthdefs"))

```
