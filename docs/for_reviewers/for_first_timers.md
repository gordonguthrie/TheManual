## If this is your first time writing synths in SuperCollider

I have tried to write this manual as simply and as step-by-step as possible. The aim is to make it possible for someone who is neither a proficient ruby programmer nor a proficient SuperCollider one to work through the manual step-by-step and recreate a working clone of the `beep` synthesiser.

Things I want to know:

* Does it work? So if you breeze through and don't have any problems ***TELL ME*** gordon@hypernumbers.com
* Where do you get stuck? If you get stuck [raise an issue of GitHub](https://github.com/gordonguthrie/TheManual/issues)
* What did you get past successfully but you didn't understand? And why? [raise an issue of GitHub](https://github.com/gordonguthrie/TheManual/issues)

If you are struggling with the whole GitHub/issues/doing stuff bit then you can still just email me gordon@hypernumbers.com
