## Chapter 5 - Recreating the beep Synth

A simple beep synthesiser - 2nd version in SuperCollider

This synth accepts the following parameters:

* `note` a midi note
* `amp` a volume
* `pan` a location to pan to
* `sustain` the time the sound lasts: WATCH OUT! - this is not called `duration`

     // and set the volume
